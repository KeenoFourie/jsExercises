// Definitions:

// Variable:
        // It stores data temporarily in a computer's memory.  (containers for storing information)
// Value:
        // It is assigned to a variable. (It is a data type)
// Data type:
        // The type of value a variable has assigned to it. (number, boolean, string, etc)
// Initialization:
        // It is storing a value in a variable.
// Tell me the difference between let, var, and const:
        // let = used to declare a block scoped variable.
        // var = used to reassign values. (with hoisting behaviour)(declares globally)
        // const = used if you don't want a variable to change.
// What is a variable scope:
        // It determines the accessibility of variables.
// When can you decide when to use a for or while, forEach and do while loop:
        // Use for loop to repeat a specific code a known number of times and use while loop to repeat a specific code a unknown amount of times.
        // Use forEach loop when you want to loop the values in an array.
        // Use do while loop when array needs to be executed at least one time.
// Define hoisting and variable scoping:
        // Hoisting is whe you move function declarations to the top of the file.
        // It determines the accessibility of variables.
